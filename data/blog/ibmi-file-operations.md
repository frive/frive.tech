We are finally at the last stride in modernizing our .NET stack. The final feature of ASNA Datagate that we need to port is its native I/O access to `Db2 for i`.

The following table shows the IBMi system objects and their equivalent SQL. This map is essential in transitioning from native I/O to `SQL`.

| System | SQL |
| - | - |
| `Library`. Groups related objects and allows you to find the objects by name. | `Schema`. Consists of a library, a journal, a journal receiver, an SQL catalog, and optionally a data dictionary. A schema groups related objects and allows you to find the objects by name. |
| `Physical file`. A set of records. | `Table`. A set of columns and rows. |
| `Record`. A set of fields. |  `Row`. The horizontal part of a table containing a serial set of columns. |
| `Field`. One or more characters of related information of one data type. | `Column`. The vertical part of a table of one data type. |
| `Logical file`. A subset of fields and records of one or more physical files. | `View`. A subset of columns and rows of one or more tables. |

### Native I/O

Native I/O is the traditional method for accessing data for [DDS](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.4?topic=programming-dds)-described logical and physical files in a predefined sequence.

A sample code taken from ASNA's documentation:

```c
DclDiskFile CMASTNEWL1 +
  Type(*Input) +
  Org(*indexed) +
  DB(DB400) +
  NetBlockFactor(100) +
  Impopen(*No) +
  File ("TestLib/CMASTNEWL1")

Chain CMASTNEWL1 CustNumber NotFnd(*In60)

If *In60 = *ON
  Subfile1AgentName = *Blanks
Else
  Subfile1AgentName = CustName
Endif
```

### SQL (Structured Query Language)

[Db2 for i](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.4?topic=concepts-db2-i) has `SQL` processing capability integrated into the system. This is what we'll utilize to translate native I/O data access.

#### File Operations

These are the native I/O file operations that we will be converting.

**Positioning operation:**
* [`SETLL`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.4?topic=codes-setll-set-lower-limit)
* [`SETGT`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.4?topic=codes-setgt-set-greater-than)

**Read operation:**
* [`READ`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.4?topic=codes-read-read-record)
* [`READP`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.4?topic=codes-readp-read-prior-record)
* [`READE`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.4?topic=codes-reade-read-equal-key)
* [`READPE`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.4?topic=codes-readpe-read-prior-equal)
* [`CHAIN`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.4?topic=codes-chain-random-retrieval-from-file)

**Create operation:**
* [`WRITE`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.4?topic=codes-write-create-new-records)

**Update operation:**
* [`UPDATE`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.4?topic=codes-update-modify-existing-record)

**Delete operation:**
* [`DELETE`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.4?topic=codes-delete-delete-record)

Create, update and delete operations are direct translations of [`INSERT`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.4?topic=statements-insert), [`UPDATE`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.4?topic=statements-update), and [`DELETE`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.4?topic=statements-delete) `SQL` statements respectively. Note that `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations need to do a read operation first before being used.

The positioning and read operations are quite tricky since they are used in conjunction with one another. For instance, `SETLL` and `SETGT` are usually used first to specify the file's position before allowing reading using any of the read operations. We'll be playing a lot with the [`where clause`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.4?topic=subselect-where-clause) and a bit of [`order by clause`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.4?topic=subselect-order-by-clause).

The [`SELECT`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.4?topic=queries-subselect) statement is the easiest ‚Äì we specify all the columns of the table. The table's sorting is critical as this sets how we read each row. We need to sort it by the [key field name](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.4?topic=28-key-field-name) for `DDS` and primary or index keys for [`DDL`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.4?topic=programming-data-definition-language). The `where clause` should also be based on the same keys when a `search argument` is specified.

#### File/Record Lock
Read operations have the option of locking the entire file or a record. 

Locking a file is as easy as running this command:

```sql
lock table zschema.ztable in exclusive mode
```

For record locks, adding this at the end of the `select` statement would do the trick:

```sql
with rs use and keep exclusive locks
```

`ASNA` throws an exception whenever another process wants to access a locked file. To do the same, we can check the lock status of a file using this query:

```sql
select * from qsys2.record_lock_info
where system_table_name = 'ztable'
and system_table_schema = 'zschema'
```

We throw an exception when we found a record.

#### Temporary Tables
Some `RPG` programs create and insert data into a table in [`QTEMP`](https://www.rpgpgm.com/2014/09/use-qtemp-for-your-work-files.html). This table is then read by some other programs for display or as a parameter for a separate program. This works as long as all of these programs run on the same job. The same is true when we call this program in `.NET`. We can still access `QTEMP` during the connection's lifetime. Accessing data in `QTEMP` is the same as with a regular library:

```sql
select * from qtemp.ztable
```

#### File Members
Files can have multiple members. Fortunately, IBMi does have a [sql way](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/accessing-files-multiple-members-using-sql) to achieve the same.

```sql
create or replace alias qtemp.ztable_zmember for zschema.ztable(zmember)
```

The alias is created in `QTEMP` library, so we don't have to remove it. `QTEMP` only lives for the duration of the job. 

#### Journal
[Transactions](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.4?topic=control-transactions) can't be used for non-journaled files. We have to enable journaling for some files so we can [lock the records](#filerecord-lock) using a transaction.

#### Isolation Levels
Set isolation level to `NC` or `NONE` during insert or update operations on non-journaled files. Otherwise, we'll get a [`SQL7008N`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=errors-sql7008n) error.

```sql
insert into zschema.ztable values ('a', 'b') with nc
```

#### RRN
The [Relative Record Number](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.4?topic=functions-rrn) identifies which position in a file the record is. I used this to update and delete data for tables that didn't have a primary key.

```sql
select rrn(employee), lastname
from employee
where deptno = 20
```

### Conclusion
We've made our .NET stack simpler by removing ASNA's server and client components and writing full .NET code(`C#`) instead of `AVR`. This brought pure joy and happiness with the developers and system administrators maintaining its server component. 

There's also an 80%-90% decrease in compile time for the projects.
